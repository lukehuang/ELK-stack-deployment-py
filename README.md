# ELK-stack-deployment-py
a sensor platform that is setup using a python script.

I am sure there are many better ways to do this. However I do not have enough time nor experiance to write this in a more effective language. So seeing as how I know python am going to do my best to tackle a problem that exsists in todays cyber world that helps deploy a sensor platform a little easier for users that need something to use and deploy on their networks. I am using all open source software and python is the language I feel more comfortable with. I welcome all comments and helpful suggestions. 

This sensor platform will be based around the following software. I am aware there are other solutions out there but have not seen anything that screams that it is better for my use case.

Suricata
Bro
ELK

---Future plans----
Create a plugin that writes bro logs to a kafka topic instead of disk.
Create a plugin that writes suricata eve.json to a kafka topic instead of disk.
Create a script/software that can mimic the ability present in sec onion that lets you pivot to pcap files from kibana.
